My name is **Joshua Kamp**, and I work as a Junior Malware Analyst with a focus on mobile malware. I've been interested in technology ever since I was a kid, when I built a RuneScape private server at the age of 9. I'm currently interested in malware analysis, reverse engineering, and exploitation.


I graduated cum laude from the Information & Communication Technology bachelor at [The Hague University of Applied Sciences](https://www.thuas.com/) in 2023. My graduation programme was in Cyber Security Technology, and I participated in the first edition of the Software Reversing and Exploitation minor (which was a lot of fun!). 


I started this blog in April 2022, with the goal of sharing (technical) knowledge and keeping track of my learning progress. I enjoy writing, and I hope to help people learn more about malware through this page.
